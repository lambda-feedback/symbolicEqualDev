# SymbolicEqual

This function utilises the [`SymPy`](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/index.html) to provide a maths-aware comparsion of a student's response to the correct answer. This means that mathematically equivalent inputs will be marked as correct. Note that `pi` is a reserved constant and cannot be used as a symbol name.

Note that this function is designed to handle comparisons of mathematical expressions but has some limited ability to handle comparison of equations as well. More precisely, if the answer is of the form $f(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = g(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ and the response is of the form $\tilde{f}(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = \tilde{g}(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ then the function checks if $f(x_1,\ldots,x_n) - g(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ is a multiple of $\tilde{f}(x_1,\ldots,x_n) / \tilde{g}(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$.

## Inputs

### Optional grading parameters

There are eight optional parameters that can be set: `complexNumbers`, `elementary_functions`, `specialFunctions`, `strict_syntax`,  `symbol_assumptions`, `multiple_answers_criteria`, `plus_minus` and `minus_plus`.

## `complexNumbers`

If you want to use `I` for the imaginary constant, set the grading parameter `complexNumbers` to True.

## `elementary_functions`

When using implicit multiplication function names with mulitple characters are sometimes split and not interpreted properly. Setting `elementary_functions` to true will reserve the function names listed below and prevent them from being split. If a name is said to have one or more alternatives this means that it will accept the alternative names but the reserved name is what will be shown in the preview.

`sin`, `sinc`, `csc` (alternative `cosec`), `cos`, `sec`, `tan`, `cot` (alternative `cotan`), `asin` (alternative `arcsin`), `acsc` (alternatives `arccsc`, `arccosec`), `acos` (alternative `arccos`), `asec` (alternative `arcsec`), `atan` (alternative `arctan`), `acot` (alternatives `arccot`, `arccotan`), `atan2` (alternative `arctan2`), `sinh`, `cosh`, `tanh`, `csch` (alternative `cosech`), `sech`, `asinh` (alternative `arcsinh`), `acosh` (alternative `arccosh`), `atanh` (alternative `arctanh`), `acsch` (alternatives `arccsch`, `arcosech`), `asech` (alternative `arcsech`), `exp` (alternative `Exp`), `E` (equivalent to `exp(1)`, alternative `e`), `log`, `sqrt`, `sign`, `Abs` (alternative `abs`), `Max` (alternative `max`), `Min` (alternative `min`), `arg`, `ceiling` (alternative `ceil`), `floor`

## `specialFunctions`

If you want to use the special functions `beta` (Euler Beta function), `gamma` (Gamma function) and `zeta` (Riemann Zeta function), set the grading parameter `specialFunctions` to True.

## `strict_syntax`

If `strict_syntax` is set to true then the answer and response must have `*` or `/` between each part of the expressions and exponentiation must be done using `**`, e.g. `10*x*y/z**2` is accepted but `10xy/z^2` is not.

If `strict_syntax` is set to false, then `*` can be omitted and `^` used instead of `**`. In this case it is also recommended to list any multicharacter symbols expected to appear in the response as input symbols.

By default `strict_syntax` is set to true.

## `symbol_assumptions`

This input parameter allows the author to set an extra assumption each symbol. Each assumption should be written on the form `('symbol','assumption name')` and all pairs concatenated into a single string.

The possible assumption names can be found in this list: 
[`SymPy Assumption Predicates`](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/guides/assumptions.html#predicates)

## `multiple_answers_criteria`

The $\pm$ and $\mp$ symbols can be represented in  the answer or response by `plus_minus` and `minus_plus` respectively.

Answers or responses that contain $\pm$ or $\mp$ has two possible interpretations which requires further criteria for equality. The grading parameter `multiple_answers_criteria` controls this. The default setting, `all`, is that each answer must have a corresponding answer and vice versa. The setting `all_responses` check that all responses are valid answers and the setting `all_answers` checks that all answers are found among the responses.

## `plus_minus` and `minus_plus`

The $\pm$ and $\mp$ symbols can be represented in  the answer or response by `plus_minus` and `minus_plus` respectively.

To use other symbols for $\pm$ and $\mp$ set the grading parameters `plus_minus` and `minus_plus` to the desired symbol. **Remark:** symbol replacement is brittle and can have unintended consequences.

## Examples

Implemented versions of these examples can be found in the module 'Examples: Evaluation Functions'.

### 1 Setting input symbols to be assumed positive to avoid issues with fractional powers

In general $\frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{b}} \neq \sqrt{\frac{a}{b}}$ but if $a > 0$ and $b > 0$ then $\frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{b}} = \sqrt{\frac{a}{b}}$. The same is true for other fractional powers.

So if expression like these are expected in the answer and/or response then it is a good idea to use the `symbol_assumptions` parameter to note that $a > 0$ and $b > 0$. This can be done by setting `symbol_assumptions` to `('a','positive') ('b','positive')`.

The example given in the example problem set uses an EXPRESSION response area that uses `SymbolicEqual` with answer `sqrt(a/b)`, `strict_syntax` set to false and `symbol_assumptions` set as above. Some examples of expressions that are accepted as correct:
`sqrt(a)/sqrt(b)`, `(a/b)**(1/2)`, `a**(1/2)/b**(1/2)`, `(a/b)^(0.5)`, `a^(0.5)/b^(0.5)`
