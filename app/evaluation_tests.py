    TestCase Class used to test the algorithm.

    Tests are used here to check that the algorithm written
    is working as it should.

    These tests are organised in classes to ensure that the same
    calling conventions can be used for tests using unittest and
    tests using pytest.

    Read the docs on how to use unittest and pytest here:
    https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html
    https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.2.x/

    Use evaluation_function() to call the evaluation function.
